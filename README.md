# HACKATHON - Stir It Up
Mongolia BBQ Social Restuarant. Order now online!


## Our Story

Itâ€™s not always what it seems. That's what we thought after hearing that Mongolian Barbecue is not really from mongolia.
What we did find is a fascinating story of man Wu Zhaonan  who created the Mongolian Barbecue.
And as we set out to make this Website 
3 aspects of this man life stuck out.

- Obviously the food. 

- The fact that he is the one who developed the mongolian Barbecue.

- And he was a Refugee: help those in need.

These 3 points are the inspiration for Stir it up.
So let me take you through the ordering process.
